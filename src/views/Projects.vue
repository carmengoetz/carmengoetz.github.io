The intention of the project was a web application focusing on mental health and awareness and to create a solution that health and wellness providers can utilize to track the history of their patients.<br/><br/>When a user creates an account, each time they log on, they are asked to enter data about their mental well-being for the day. Users have the ability to add information and data about their mental wellness on the website and view their history from previous entries. They can also give friends or wellness professionals permission to view it, to see trends and to pinpoint areas that may need attention or further treatment.<br/><br/>The project was designed and developed in a group of 6 people using Symphony as part of a Final project for a class. The project was never put into production, but the source code is available in my GitHub.",
